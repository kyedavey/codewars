// Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.
// The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
// Detailed rules
// The resulting expression is made of components like 4 seconds, 1 year, etc. In general, a positive integer and one of the valid units of time, separated by a space. The unit of time is used in plural if the integer is greater than 1.
// The components are separated by a comma and a space (", "). Except the last component, which is separated by " and ", just like it would be written in English.
// A more significant units of time will occur before than a least significant one. Therefore, 1 second and 1 year is not correct, but 1 year and 1 second is.
// Different components have different unit of times. So there is not repeated units like in 5 seconds and 1 second.
// A component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero. Hence, 1 minute and 0 seconds is not valid, but it should be just 1 minute.
// A unit of time must be used "as much as possible". It means that the function should not return 61 seconds, but 1 minute and 1 second instead. Formally, the duration specified by of a component must not be greater than any valid more significant unit of time.

// My Solution
function formatDuration(seconds) {
  if (seconds === 0) return "now";

  const unitToSeconds = {
    year: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365,
    day: 60 * 60 * 24,
    hour: 60 * 60,
    minute: 60,
    second: 1,
  };

  const result = [];

  for (const unit in unitToSeconds) {
    if (seconds >= unitToSeconds[unit]) {
      const value = Math.floor(seconds / unitToSeconds[unit]);
      result.push(`${value} ${unit}${value > 1 ? "s" : ""}`);
      seconds = seconds % unitToSeconds[unit];
    }
  }

  return result.join(", ").replace(/,([^,]+)$/g, " and$1");
}
