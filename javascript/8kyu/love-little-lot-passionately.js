// Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:
// "I love you"
// "a little"
// "a lot"
// "passionately"
// "madly"
// "not at all"
// If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with "I love you" for 7 petals, "a little" for 8 petals and so on.
// When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.
// Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals. The number of petals is always greater than 0.

// My Solution
function howMuchILoveYou(nbPetals) {
  let responces = [
    "I love you",
    "a little",
    "a lot",
    "passionately",
    "madly",
    "not at all",
  ];
  return responces[(nbPetals - 1) % 6];
}

// Some improvements
const phrases = [
  "I love you",
  "a little",
  "a lot",
  "passionately",
  "madly",
  "not at all",
];

function howMuchILoveYou(n) {
  return phrases[(n - 1) % phrases.length];
}

// Object
function howMuchILoveYou(nbPetals) {
  let phrase = {
    0: "not at all",
    1: "I love you",
    2: "a little",
    3: "a lot",
    4: "passionately",
    5: "madly",
  };
  return phrase[nbPetals % 6];
}
