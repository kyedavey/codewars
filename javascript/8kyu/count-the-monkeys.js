// You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.
// As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

// My Solution
function monkeyCount(n) {
  return Array.from(new Array(n), (x, i) => i + 1);
}

// Loop
function monkeyCount(n) {
  var monkeys = [];
  for (var i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
    monkeys.push(i);
  }
  return monkeys;
}
