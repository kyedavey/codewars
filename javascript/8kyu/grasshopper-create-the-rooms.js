// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

// My Solution
const rooms = {
  1: {
    name: "1",
    description: "1",
    completed: true,
  },
  2: {
    name: "2",
    description: "2",
    completed: true,
  },
  3: {
    name: "2",
    description: "2",
    completed: true,
  },
};
